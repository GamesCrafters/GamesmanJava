Various solvers for connect4, including one using spark

VERSIONS --
Spark 2.4.7
Hadoop 2.7

Currently using the "Tier" package

Things for future:

Change byte value to 0-255 where maxing is always the best
Add interface for games so no direct calls
Optimize c4 hash/board state
    Add top down solver instead of bottom up

Bug fixing
Setup on savio machine

Add documentation

Justins group
C stuff
